# myFlatLightLogin
This is a continued project from the YouTube tutorial "How to Design a Flat Light Login Page in C#" with my add-ons. 

I created this project initially in the Tutorials repository. The following is the description from the Readme there:

9. C# WPF UI | How to Design Beautiful Music Player App in WPF - Added 230320, from YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txQm1WxFsqo&t=28s 
	- Folder: MusicPlayer
	- Solution name: MusicPlayer.sln
	- Framework: .Net 7.0

I went through that tutorial and then copied the finished solution and started to work with it making my modifications which includes among others:
  - Implementing the MVVM pattern and thus removing code-behind
  - Implementing the Minimize, Maximize, and Exit buttons
  - Changing a few things in the look and feel, suiting how I would like to have it. 

For a comparison, open this solution in conjunction with the tutorial solution and run the two applications. 

Also, this is an ongoing development so the look will probably change over time depending on how much time is spent on this project.
